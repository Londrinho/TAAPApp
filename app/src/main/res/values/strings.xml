    <string name="about_texts">OUR MISSION \nWe deliver new and innovative ways to undergo digital transformation.\n\nOur core principle is to provide hyper agile delivery through a ‘configure not code’ approach.\n\nWe don’t just talk about No-code we help organisations see this technology come to life, using plain English but driven from the perspective of business and operational best practices.\n\nDelayed development, costly builds or software acquisition, before long the new system becomes like other old legacy systems.\n\nFundamentally the landscape of change management projects are changing. The gap between business analysts, development build and end users, there is always a disconnect. Low-Code and citizen development narrows the gap for not only miscommunication between teams but hyper agile development from the start.\n\nHere is where TAAP has been changing the way software is not only developed but reducing implementation time, full integration with current software, and the ability to change and expand applications all while reducing costs.\n\n</string>
